TextMate bundle for writing Sequence Diagrams using pic

Contains the sequence diagram macros from http://www.umlgraph.org/ in a template, with a few tweaks.

Has a command for previewing the sequence diagram in Preview, and for saving it to pdf (requires pic2plot and epstopdf).

pic2plot is contained in the umlgraph package at http://www.umlgraph.org/

One way to get epstopdf on Mac is:
sudo port install tetex

To install bundle with git:

  mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
  git clone git://github.com/lastobelus/sequence_diagram.tmbundle.git
  osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
